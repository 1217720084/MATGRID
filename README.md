The software package provides the solution of the AC and DC power flow, the non-linear and DC state estimation, as well as the state estimation with PMUs, with built-in measurments generator.

## Modules

There are three basic modules:
   - **power flow** - using the executive m-file *power_flow.m* runs the AC and DC power flow;
   - **state estimation** - using the executive m-file *state_estimation.m* runs the non-linear, DC and PMU state estimation;
   - **state estimation with built-in measurments generator *power_estimation.m* - using the executive m-file *power_estimation* runs the AC power flow, generates a set of measurements and continues with the state estimation;
   
Note: The state estimation with PMUs is currently not available
